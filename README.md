# CARECitizenver1

## Description
CARE Citizen is a project that develops an air quality monitoring system consisting of an open hardware node and a cloud platform in order to increase the number of data points by encouraging the general public to be a data contributor through citizen science. 

This page contains the firmware for the CARE Citizen node which measures Relative Humidity and Temperature (RH/T), PM2.5, PM10, and CO2. The data gathered is sent to the CARE Citizen platform which stores the data and allows it to be visualized on a dashboard with charts and maps. This project abides by the open hardware principle as such the schematic, firmware, and 3D mounting files, etc. are freely available for the public at the CARE Citizen website.
